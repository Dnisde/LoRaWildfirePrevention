Exploration of wide-area distributed sensor networks for prediction and prevention of wildfires.

## Problem Statement

Wildfire occurances have been increasing in frequency and severity over the last several decades. The areas prone to forest fires has doubled from 1984 to 2015, indicating a trend of increasing risk of catastrophic wildfire events.[(1)](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/42/11770) The economic impact has been especially exemplified in California, where the fires in 2018 have led to an estimated loss of approximately $150 billion, when far reaching factors such as health impacts of wildfire smoke and supply chain interruptions are considered.
