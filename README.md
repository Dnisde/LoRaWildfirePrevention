Exploration of low-cost LoRaWAN based wide-area distributed sensor networks for prediction and prevention of wildfires.

## Problem Statement

Wildfire occurances have been increasing in frequency and severity over the last several decades. The areas prone to forest fires has doubled from 1984 to 2015, indicating a trend of increasing risk of catastrophic wildfire events.[(1)](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/42/11770) The economic impact has been especially exemplified in California, where the fires in 2018 alone have led to an estimated loss of approximately $150 billion, when far reaching factors such as health impacts of wildfire smoke and supply chain interruptions are considered. [(2)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-020-00646-7) This is an estimated 1.5% loss of the total GDP of California, and 0.5% loss of the total GDP of the United States.

Some of the long reaching effects of these losses are the "hardening" of the reinsurance market[(3)](https://www.actuaries.digital/2021/04/29/a-hardening-reinsurance-market-how-to-mitigate-the-adverse-impact/), which will cause securing adequate insurance coverage to become more costly and difficult, and the increasing cost of building materials[(4)](https://www.businessobserverfl.com/article/from-home-improvement-to-home-building-shortages-causing-major-delays-and-cancellations-for-builders-and-contractors), which will have the a similar effect on increasing the cost of post-disaster reconstruction effors.

This indicates that a moving to a proactive early prediction, detection and prevention of wildfires could have a profound impact on the mitigation of extremely costly wildfire events.
